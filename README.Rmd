This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

To create this README I made an Rmarkdown file in  RStudio.

####Markdown Formats
To make that heading, I put #### in front of my text. The text size can be changed by increasing or decreasing the number of #s.

The text can be made *italic* or **bold** by placing surrounding text with single or double *, respectively. Additonally, _ may be used instead of *, allowing more elaborate formatting.

In order to save this README, I saved it into a directory on my computer located at C:\Users\Rosen_000\Documents\R projects\Practical computing\homework

We will be using GIT to track our changes. Initially, I tracked them on my local computer by using the following commands:

1. cd documents/'R projects'/'practical computing/homework
..*this gets me into the correct working directory
2. git status
..* this shows what branch I'm on and what files are there.
3. git add README.Rmd
..* This adds the file to the staging area
4. git commit -m 'preliminary README'
..* THis commits the file with a message to future me

I then made a repository on the github website used the following command to initiate it
>git remote add origin https://github.com/Isaac-Rosenthal/Intro-to-practical-computing.git

I checked that it worked by doing
>git remote -v

Finally, I pushed my local file to the remote repository by doing:
>git push origin master

I entered my login info when prompted, and as you are reading this online it has clearly worked.
