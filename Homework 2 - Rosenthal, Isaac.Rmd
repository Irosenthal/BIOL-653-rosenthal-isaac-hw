#**Plots**

First, load the required ibraries

```
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
```


####**1) Plot 1**
```
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, by = continent)) + # begin by specifying dataset, axis, and grouping
  geom_point(aes(color = continent, shape = continent, size = continent)) + # Now, create a scatter plot by creating a layer. Specify how the variables are displayed on the graph.
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(19, 17, 15, 3, 7)) + # Create a matrix to individually change the shape for each continent
  scale_size_manual(values = c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4)) + # create a matrix to individually change the size of each point
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) # change the size of the text. More layers could be added to adjust label positions, add titles, etc.
```
  
####**2) Plot 2**
```
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, by = continent)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = continent, shape = continent, size = continent)) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(19, 17, 15, 3, 7)) +
  scale_size_manual(values = c(4 ,4, 4, 4, 4, 4)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) +
  scale_x_log10() # Transform the scale of a specified axis with this command. Other transformations can be used instead of log10.
```  
  
####**3) Plot 3**
```
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, by = continent)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = continent, shape = continent, size = continent)) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(19, 17, 15, 3, 7)) +
  scale_size_manual(values = c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4)) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, aes(group = 1)) # without specifying the group it will generate a line for each continent.
``` 
  
####**4) Plot 4** 
```
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
      geom_density(kernel = 'gaussian', aes(), alpha = .4, size = .75) +
      theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) +
      facet_wrap(~ year) # tells it which variable to facet the plots by. Fun to play with, I made a huge plot by country and a useless one by continent.
```

####**5) Plot 5**
```
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(color = continent)) +
      theme(text = element_text(size = 25), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90)) + # an example of a layer that adjusts the axis text in more elaborate ways than just size. Still just scratching the surface here, but at least this makes it readable.
      facet_wrap(~ year)
```      
####**6) Plot 6**
```
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
      geom_density(kernel = 'gaussian', aes(), alpha = .4, size = .75) +
      theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) 
```
Nothing to see here, this one was easy.

####**7) Plot 7**
```
str(gapminder) # Check the structure of gapminder before messing around too much with dplyr, just to get your head on straight
```

```
filter(gapminder, continent == 'Asia') %>% # I only want data about Asia so it's safe to filter out everything else
ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
      geom_density(kernel = 'gaussian', aes(), alpha = .4, size = .75) +
      scale_fill_manual(values = c('green')) +
      geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(lifeExp))) + # this was a serious pain, I had trouble finding a concise write up on geom_vline. After an hour struggle, I realized I had mispelled xintercept, woops.
      theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) # Did you notice I know how to change the text size?
```     
    
####**8) Plot 8**

First I made a new data frame with only continent and mean life expectancy

```
mean_life <- data.frame(group_by(gapminder, continent) %>%  
    summarise(mean = mean(lifeExp)))
```
Then I plotted it.

```
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +              
      geom_density(kernel = 'gaussian', aes(), alpha = .4, size = .75) +
      theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) +
      geom_vline(data = mean_life, aes(xintercept = mean)) + # be sure to point it to the new data table here. I almost confused myself by having the column named mean, is there a standard protocol about not naming things the same as a function?
      facet_wrap(~ continent) 
```      
      
      
      
#**Find the mistakes**

load the modified gapinder dataset

```
library(ggplot2)

hw_gapminder <- read.csv('C:/Users/Rosen_000/Downloads/hw_gapminder.csv')

str(hw_gapminder)
```

####**1) Given:**

```
mean_lifeExp <- mean(hw_gapminder$lifeExpe)
```

####**Fixed:**
    
```
mean_lifeExp <- mean(hw_gapminder$lifeExp) # removed the extra "e" at the end 
```

####**2) Given:**

```
small_set <- hw_gapminder[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 1300:1304), ('country', 'continent', 'year')]
```

####**Fixed:**
```
small_set <- hw_gapminder[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 1300:1304), c('country', 'continent', 'year')] # added a "c" before the list of columns to include 
```

####**3) Given:** 
```
mean_gdp <- mean(hw_gapminder$gdpPercap)
```
####**Fixed:**
```    
mean_gdp <- mean(hw_gapminder$gdpPercap, na.rm = TRUE) # added na.rm = TRUE, allowing to calculate the mean even though there was some missing data or something in there.
```
####**Given:**
```
max_country <- hw_gapminder$country[which(hw_gapminder$lifeExp = max(hw_gapminder$lifeExp))]
```

####**Fixed:**
```
max_country <- hw_gapminder$country[which(hw_gapminder$lifeExp == max(hw_gapminder$lifeExp))] # Needed an extra "=", although it generated a sligthly different result than the one on the website; mine showed levels. 
```
