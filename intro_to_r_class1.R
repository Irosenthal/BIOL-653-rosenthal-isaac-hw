# syntax
# functions do something
# functions take arguemnts
# function(arg1, arg2, arg3)
mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE)  # x is list of values, trim trims outliers, 0 is default,don't NEED to write it but helps remember, na.rm means do you want me to remove NAs (no data) before calculating mean?
